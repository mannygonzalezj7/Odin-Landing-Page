# Odin-Landing-Page

Odin Landing Page Project from OdinProject.

This project used HTML and CSS to make an outline via description provided by the Odin Project.

Throughout this project, I practiced and adapted the use of flexbox, css properties such as border-radius, CSS Pseudo-Classes such as :hover and :active, as well as padding. This project helped me familiarize myself with flexbox components and all of the HTML/CSS I would need for a basic website.
